            As if that wasn't enough of a wild deviation from the norm. A slight chill drifted through the cell and a whistling sound could be heard as the wind eased its way through the cracks in the mortar of the brick building. A skinny man of about 5'10" stood in the middle of the cell, his arms stretched outward as if he was expecting to levitated upward and begin flight. He was just skin, bone, and hair, his clothes torn from being worn for days on end. Under such circumstances, it was strange that the man would have such a jovial look on his face. Arms stretched like an eagle, and a smile from ear to ear, wearing tattered and ragged clothing, the man would've been a strange sight to have seen in any situation, and if there were anyone else in the cell to take witness of his actions, they would surely think that he had lost his mind from being kept in isolation for so long. Footsteps could be heard climbing stairs outside the cell. The man opened his eyes and slowly put his arms back at his side, the smile stayed fixed on his face as he turned from facing the wall to now facing the wooden door. The door was equipped with a food slot and was just large enough for a single person to pass through at a time. The man waited patiently as he heard a key slip into the keyhole and begin to turn. The door opened inward and a short bearded man made his way into the cell. It was the jail keeper. He gave the cell a look over before turning his attention to the man in the tattered clothes standing in the middle of the room. "I wish I could wipe that smile from your face, luckily it's the last time I'll ever have to see it.", the jail keeper said. "The warden asked me to do the honors today; you know he isn't feeling too well." The jail keeper motioned to the man to move towards the door. "Come on now Mr. Gratson, you've been here for 5 years, I'm sure your ready to leave." The man looked around the cell one last time. Taking note of the bricks, the cobwebs, the uneven floor, the bed, if you can even call it that, and the high ceiling, which he always dreamed of flying through and breaking away. Mr. Gratson had served his sentence and it was now his time to be free once more.

        <p class="story">
            John Gratson was a soldier; he had served in the British royal navy and was a loyal supporter of King George the third. He left his home when he was seventeen to serve as a member of a merchant crew, transporting goods from Great Britain to the colonies in the Caribbean. After two long years transporting cargo between continents, war broke out between France and Britain. John enlisted as a member of the royal navy without hesitation. He always felt that if there was anything he could do for his country he would be obligated to help. Gratson knew that in battle defeat was far better than surrender, but in the spring of 1811 the ship aptly named, “The Victory”, that he had been assigned as first mate on was surrounded by French and Spanish ships in the English Channel. The captain of The Victory, seeing that his ship was outnumbered and outgunned, surrendered. Gratson saw no alternate course of action and always defended his captain. If they had fought, they surely would have all been killed. Five long years later the wars were officially over and Gratson along with his other crew members, had been released from the prison where they had been held on charges of high treason. Surrender in the royal navy was not taken lightly. Gratson walked across the yard past the two guards who gave him a piercing stare. He took one last look behind him at the place he’d sadly begun to know as him home and stepped out past the gates.        </p>

        <h4 class="display-4 text-center mt-4 mb-4 chaptertitle">A Mysterious Letter</h4>
        <p class="story">
            A letter slide quietly underneath the gap at the bottom of a large mahogany door. Inscribed on the front of the letter read the words, “Urgent, for one Mr. William Falerton.” Footsteps could be heard outside the door and soon a key unlocked the door and a man walked in. Professor Falerton upon seeing the letter, eyed it cautiously for a few seconds, then without hesitation, quickly picked it up from off the wood floor. He didn't recognize the handwriting as that of any of his colleagues at the University. He set it alongside the books and papers he had under his right arm and continued to walk towards the back of his neatly kept office towards his desk. He sat down with a gesture of relief and satisfaction placing the stack consisting of the books, papers, and the letter on the desk. It had been a long day and he was in need of some time alone to rest. First he wanted to attend to the matter of the letter. He grabbed his letter opener with his right hand and the letter with his left, neatly opening the letter with extreme precision and obvious experience. Once opened, he grabbed the letter out that was folded into thirds. He unfolded the letter and began reading.



            “Dear Mr. William Falerton,
            
                                            I am quite aware of your expertise in geological, archaeological, and navigational matters. Your skill set is uniquely varied and your experience speaks for itself. For the want of privacy, I will keep this letter short and vague. I will answer all your questions when we meet in person. I am a member of the reform club and I have been interested in matters of the ancients for most of my life. A map has recently come into my possession that details the location of a lost city. As you can imagine I am intrigued. I must know if this 'lost city' exists. This is why I am putting together an expedition and I would like you to be the head of this expedition. I have already reached out to the other necessary members and I have purchased a ship capable of the voyage along with the appropriate supplies. If you would like to accept my offer please meet me at 9:00am tomorrow morning at the reform club. You will be compensated ten times the normal amount you receive at the University. You will also have the honor of publishing any new discoveries in the sciences.
            
             Your Friend,
            
                  Mr. S”
            
            
            
                Professor Falerton reread the letter and stared at it in disbelief. Could this be a prank by his students or his colleagues? Most likely it would turn out to be just that, but Professor Falerton was never one to give up on investigating a good mystery.        </p>
