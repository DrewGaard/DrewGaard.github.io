        <p class="story">
            The rain crashed to the ground as the man walked towards the ruins of the once magnificent castle. As he neared the remains he noticed a flickering of light from atop one of the once great guard towers, which clearly displayed the shadows of three strange looking creatures. The man ran for cover as he noticed one of the shadows begin to stand. A bush near the base of the castle was the best he could do. He crouched making sure that his sword and shield where under his rain drenched cloak. The shadow had now become a visible living creature, as he stared out through the gaps in the bush he saw it. It was as he had thought, a northern goblin. He had heard stories of the goblins that presided in the north. Attempts had been made by many men after wars and battles to create an alliance with the goblins, yet the goblins had no interest in peace. There only interest was there own well being and gold. When the great war of Alsinsheg started men came to the goblins in hopes of forming an alliance against their foe. The goblins cared not of the cause of the war. They only cared about their payment and their share of the spoils if they were victorious. Goblins during that time were on the side of man for the right price. Now there alliances had shifted and so had their greed. The man knew that if he wanted to escape from the cold unforgiving rain and decrease the possibility of dying from hypothermia he had to get inside the castle. Half of the castle gate had fallen off into the moat, which was now almost overflowing. What remained of the draw bridge was a narrow board allowing for one cautious person at a time to cross without falling into the moat. When he saw the goblins shadow once again he made a run for it, but as he turned from behind the bush his cloak caught on one of the branches. He slipped on the mud and fell on his back. He looked up at the tower. As far as he could tell the three goblins were still sitting around their fire. He unhooked his cloak from the bush and ran. The thin air was taking a toll on his already tired body. He gasped for air as he ran, desperately in need of warmth and shelter. He came to the draw bridge and without sizing up the thin piece of wood that it had now become, he jumped on it and balanced across. He had made it into the castle ruins. He leaned against the castle wall and feel. Exhausted his body couldn't take anymore. He fell into a deep sleep that he so desperately needed.

            BANG! A noise echoed off the castle walls. The man looked up around him, astonished that he could've fallen asleep under such dangerous circumstances. He fully expected to see the goblins that he had seen the night before as he pulled himself to his feet. BANG! He heard the noise again. It was coming from the tower where he had first seen the goblins. He drew his sword and proceeded towards the staircase. Before beginning his ascent he removed his cloak and took one last look at the baron remains of the castle courtyard. The tower stairs were crumbling apart with every step the man took. They were also wet from leaks in the tower walls where rainfall had slipped through. The climb was slow as he continued creeping up the tower stairs, trying to keep his footing precise and quite. He heard voices echoing down the stairs. The voices seemed to be getting louder. He tightened his grip on his sword as he continued climbing. The voices were now loud enough that he could make out what they were saying. "One of you runts stole my breakfast!", he could hear one of the goblins yell. "It wasn't me! It was probably Grent. You know how he get's around food", said one of the other goblins. He heard one of the goblins let out a loud grunt, presumably in response to the second goblins comment about how he is around food. "Well don't let it happen again or I'll make sure you don't get food for a week.", said the first goblin. "Alright boss! I won't do it again", said the second goblin. "YOU WON'T DO IT AGAIN!", shouted the first goblin. "Ummm maybe I said that the wrong way.", the second goblin said. "You little runt", the first goblin shouted. All of a sudden there was another loud, BANG! The sound continued to reverberate down the stairs and get closer to the man now standing with his sword raised, ready to strike.

            They rolled past him like a boulder falling down a mountain. He wondered if they'd even seen him as he leaned against the walls of the tower, as to avoid the goblins now rolling down the towers spiral staircase. The two goblins rolling down the stairs hadn't noticed him, but the goblin running down after the other two had. The goblin let out a loud, "YEEEEK!". The man raised his sword ready to strike then the goblin feel to the floor on his knees. The goblin clasped his hands together and shook them at the man indicating that he wished for mercy. The man stared at him then lowered his sword. Just then a shout was heard at the bottom of the tower stairs, "Grent! Where are you? We need to get moving!". The man motioned to the goblin to respond, which he did by letting out a loud grunt. Presumably the only sound the goblin was capable of creating. The man then beckoned Grent to walk down the stairs in front of him. As Grent reached the bottom of the stairs one of the goblins said, "There you are Grent. You really need to lay off the food if it takes you that long to get down those stairs.". The goblin making the comments was going to continue insulting Grent until he saw the man with his sword trailing behind Grent. "I see you picked up a friend while you were messing around up there", said one of the goblins. Then the goblin who looked to be in charge of the group said, "Who are you and what do you want with us?". "My name is Dellren.", the man proclaimed. "I really don't want anything to do with you. I was merely looking for shelter last night when I saw you at the top of the tower.", stated Dellren. "Why didn't you just leave us be then?", said the goblin. "I am a mercenary. I have been hired to help the men in the north fight against their enemies and it looks like goblins have shifted their alliance against that of the north.", Dellren replied. The goblin smiled, "Ah, so you assumed we are like all the other goblins did you. Well surprise. We aren't. We are outcasts, failures, deserters. We left the goblin army when their alliance shifted. We don't want to be involved in pointless wars.", said the goblin. Dellren was surprised by what he had heard, but he didn't believe any of it. The goblin saw the look on his face and said, "My name is Jrent. Perhaps you've heard of me.". Dellren had heard stories of a goblin named Jrent, once the king of the Goblins he sought to maintain peace with man in order to work together so that both society's could strive. Jrent was removed from power by goblin merchants whose profits had taken a hit when he decreed that prices on common goods should be lowered so that all goblins could afford basic necessities. Drent said, "Here maybe this will persuade you of who I really am.". Drent pulled out dagger from his coat pocket and handed it to Dellren. The dagger was covered in a leather case with words engraved on it. It read, "Peace, prosperity, and advancement". Dellren knew this was the blade given to Jrent after he had signed the goblin-man treaty 20 years ago.
