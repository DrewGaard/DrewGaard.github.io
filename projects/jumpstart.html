    <p class="text-center">JumpStart was a project developed by a team of 4 application developers, including myself, for our application development class. JumpStart is a workout application that allows users to run through short but intense 7 minute workouts. JumpStart was created using the waterfall method of program design. We created documents including UML diagrams, paper prototypes, and use case diagrams to help us build JumpStart. JumpStart was programmed entirely in Java using the swing library for the GUI.</p>
