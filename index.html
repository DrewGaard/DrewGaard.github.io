    <p class="aboutMeParagraph">Hello World! My name is Drew Overgaard and I am a software developer from Stockton California. I attended the University of the Pacific where I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science, specializing in software development. My interest in computers started long before college. In the sixth grade I discovered Game Maker Studios, a software that allowed anyone to create games using a drag and drop system alongside simple programming. I spent many days creating games and adding mods to games other people had created. In high school my interest in programming continued. I developed simple applications for my android smartphone and published them on the Google Play store. One of my applications had over 10000 downloads! I knew then that I wanted to expand my knowledge of programming so that I could develop something on a much larger scale. I attended my local community college, San Joaquin Delta College, where I continued to enroll in entry level computer science courses. In spring 2015 I applied to the University of the Pacific as part of the school of engineering and computer science. Since I had taken most all of my general education courses at my local community college I was able to devote my time to my core computer science classes and working. While at the University of the Pacific, I worked full time for Pacific's IT department, which is responsible for providing IT services to all three of Pacific's campuses; Stockton, Sacramento, and San Fransisco. During this time I worked for the Digital Media Department.</p>
