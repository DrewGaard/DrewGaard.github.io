                        Hello World! My name is Drew Overgaard and I am a software developer from Stockton California. I attended the University of the Pacific where I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science, specializing in software development. My interest in computers started long before college.
                        In the sixth grade I discovered Game Maker Studios, a software that allowed anyone to create games using a drag and drop system alongside simple programming. I spent many days creating games and adding mods to games other people had created. In high school my interest in programming continued. I developed simple applications for my android smartphone and published them on the Google Play store.
                        One of my applications had over 10000 downloads! I knew then that I wanted to expand my knowledge of programming so that I could develop something on a much larger scale. I attended my local community college, San Joaquin Delta College, where I continued to enroll in entry level computer science courses. In spring 2015 I applied to the University of the Pacific as part of the school of engineering and computer science. Since I had taken most all of my general education courses at my local community college I was able to devote my time to my core computer science classes and working.
                        While at the University of the Pacific, I worked full time for Pacific's IT department, which is responsible for providing IT services to all three of Pacific's campuses; Stockton, Sacramento, and San Fransisco. During this time I worked for the Digital Media Department.

                    While attending school I worked part time roughly 27 hours a week as a member of the IT department at the University of the Pacific. During this time I developed an automated asset inventory system using power shell to speed up the process of generating asset inventory reports. I was also responsible for migrating the digital media teams file structure to Microsoft SharePoint. I was also responsible for helping full time staff with daily activity's, such as digital media installations and meeting with University faculty and staff.

One of our goals when creating TrackHub was to make it cross platform, so we implemented it as a website available to run in any modern web browser. TrackHub aims to be a hub for music lovers and enthusiasts to listen, share, chat, and enjoy their music experience.

                            JumpStart was a project developed by a team of 4 application developers, including myself, for our application development class. JumpStart is a workout application that allows users to run through short but intense 7 minute workouts. JumpStart was created using the waterfall method of program design. We created documents including UML diagrams, paper prototypes, and use case diagrams to help us build JumpStart. JumpStart was programmed entirely in Java using the swing library for the GUI.

                            Axle Addict is an application created using java with the purpose of matching a users personality with a car. The application also features a 0-60 calculator, quarter mile calculator, and a car search engine. I worked with a group of 5 other colleagues to create the application. Together, in under 3 months we were able to create a working application that included all the basic features we outlined at the start of the semester. We used Scrum to stay on track. The project utilizes the Google search API and the Edmund's car API.

GuitarGetter allows users to enter information into the database, retrieve information from the database, and view the database.
